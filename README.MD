**K**i**V**i is a Rust based CLI tool to browse and interract with various **K**ey-**V**alue storages.

## MVP

For MVP release will try to provide support of following KV Storages:
- `Consul` w/ token auth
- `Vault` w/ token auth
- `etcd`

## Expansion plans

In observable future might extend the reach to `Zookeper`, `Eureka` and `SurrealDB`.

## Inspiration

My pet project to learn Rust.

Crappy code expected!

**Use at own risk**.
